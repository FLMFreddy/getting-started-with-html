<p><b>How web works</b></p>
<p>
  Browser makes a request via internet to the server, the request is made by http protocol. Server then responds with files which the browser displays
</p>
<p>
  <em>HTTP</em> -> the main protocol of the web
  <br>
  <em>Servers</em> -> computers that host files that make up the web
  <br>
  <em>Internet</em> -> the world's largest computer network
  <br>
  <em>Browser</em> -> a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web
</p>
<p>
  HTML - is made up of:
  <br> - text content what you see
  <br> - markup what it looks like
  <br> - references to other documents (videos, images)
  <br> - links to other pages
</p>
<p>
  HTML markup
  <br> &lt;name&gt; tag content &lt;/name&gt;
  <br> Examples:
  <br> b tag - &lt;b&gt;content&lt;/b&gt;
  <br> em tag - &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;
  <br> There are void tags that do not have content like &lt;br&gt; tag which creates a newline in the html
</p>
<p>
  Computers are stupid - you have to tell them precisely what you want them to do.
</p>
<p>
  HTML Attribute - this is a property of an HTML tag like href in anchor tag
